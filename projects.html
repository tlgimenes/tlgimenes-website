            </h1>
            Here you can find some of my university/personal projects. 
            <p>
            Mostly of my projects are hosted on <a
                href="https://github.com/tlgimenes">GitHub</a> and have a self-explaning README
            </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li><a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://github.com/tlgimenes/RealTimeSkinRendering">Real Time Skin Rendering</a></li>
                <p>
                This is an implementation of the NVIDIA's demo of real-time skin 
                rendering.
                </p><p>
                This project was done in as the final project of a university
                course on rendering and it's not complete yet. It uses OpenGL 
                4.5 shaders for rendering and calculating the diffuse and
                specular light on the skin of the 3D model
                </p><p>
                For more informations, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/tlgimenes/RealTimeSkinRendering">Github</a>
                page of the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                You can see bellow a screenshot of the final result
                </p>

                <li><a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://github.com/tlgimenes/GPUImageSweep">GPU Image Sweep</a></li>
                <p>
                This is a full implementation of the Image Sweep algorithm in
                OpenCL 1.1 
                </p><p>
                This project was done in as the final project of a university
                course on computer vision and has as input two images as well as
                their transition matrix.
                </p><p>
                With these inputs, the program can create, using the image sweep
                algorith with the highest correlation, the 3D form of the object
                in the pictures
                </p><p>
                For more informations, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/tlgimenes/GPUImageSweep">Github</a>
                page of the project.
                </p><p>
                It was supposed to have a screenshot here, but beignet is
                complainning too much to run this code. Nvidia's OpenCL
                implementation should run it well :'(
                </p>

                        href="https://github.com/tlgimenes/SparseModelingOfIntrinsicCorrespondences">Sparse Modeling of Intrinsic Correspondences</a></li>
                <p>
                This is the partial implementation of the technique used in a
                paper with the title of Sparse Modeling of Instrinsic
                Correspondences which aims to find the correnspondence between
                two 3D models of the same object with a difference of a
                non-rigid transformation.
                </p><p>
                This project was done in as the final project of a university
                course on geometric modeling and the input is the two 3D models
                and the query in the geometry
                </p><p>
                The <a href="https://github.com/tlgimenes/SparseModelingOfIntrinsicCorrespondences">GitHub</a> 
                repository is still a mess and I hope I have time to give 
                enough attention to this project and reformulate it's repository.
                </p><p>
                Bellow you can see the screenshot of the correspondences.
