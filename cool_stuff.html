                Cool third-part projects
                <hr class="topic-content-separation"> 
            </h1>
            Here are some cool projects that I like and think they deserve a
            spot on this list
        
            <ul>
                <li><a style="text-decoration: none" href="http://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a></li>
                <p>
                Wayland is intended as a simpler replacement for X, easier to 
                develop and maintain and it's supposed to simplify the whole 
                graphics stack by forcing everything through a standard DRM 
                stack straight into the kernel and managing compositing itself.
                </p> <p>
                I'm currently using wayland as the backend of Gnome 3, another
                cool project that deserves to be in the list
                </p>
                <hr class="topic-content-separation"> 
                <li><a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://www.gnome.org/">Gnome 3</a></li>
                <p>
                Gnome 3 is an easy and elegant way to use your computer. It is 
                designed to put you in control and bring freedom to everybody.
                </p> <p>
                My current D.E. (desktop environment) is Gnome 3, more
                specifically Gnome 3.18, and I have to say that I used to be a
                Gnome 2 lover and Gnome 3 hatter, but everything changed when I
                wanted to try Wayland and one of the only options was Gnome 3,
                and I have to say that Gnome 3, thankfully, evolved from a slow,
                resource demanding and buggy D.E. into a very clean and polished
                D.E.
                </p><p>
                Bellow there is a printscreen of my current Gnome 3.18 look
                running on Wayland 
                </p>

                <li><a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://www.gnome.org/">Vulkan</a></li>
                <p>
                Vulkan is the new generation, open standard API for 
                high-efficiency access to graphics and compute on modern GPUs. 
                This ground-up design, previously referred to as the Next 
                Generation OpenGL Initiative, provides applications direct 
                control over GPU acceleration for maximized performance and 
                predictability.
                </p><p>
                Vulkan should be released before the end of 2015. As son as
                Vulkan is released I will make a post about it with my
                impressions using the new API with C++. For now. a good source
                for the latest news on Vulkan is <a href="http://vulkan-tutorial.com/">this site</a>
